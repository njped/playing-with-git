Hello World

This is called VIM

It allows me to code within the terminal

`This is a code snippet`

I was able to edit this README with the command of:
`vi README.md`

1. Then I pressed the INSERT button to start typing
2. Once I was done typing I pressed ESCAPE
3. If I want to save my changes I then enter `:wq` - think of that as write quit
4. Press Enter
